Hey there, I'm Jiayi! Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my journey through ***ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications*** at SMU. Coming from an architectural background, I've found a sweet spot at the crossroads of creativity and data. Here, numbers don't just tell stories; they sing them. In this course, I've dived deep into the world of data visualization, discovering cool ways to turn complex info into eye-catching, easy-to-understand visuals. It's been a ride ‚Äì from theory to practice, and everything in between.

One of the highlights? Our group project on the üçîBig Mac Index. Yep, you read that right! If you're as curious about what McDonald's can tell us about the world's economies (or just a fan of the iconic burger), you're in for a treat. Check out our project [website](https://bmi-pricebite.netlify.app/) and give our app a whirl. It's a fun, insightful look at global economics, McDonald's style.

I'm all about sharing insights and learning together. So, if you've got questions, ideas, or just want to chat about data (or burgers), hit me up through the links below. Let's make data a little less daunting and a lot more fun!
